In the entire world, women are underrepresented in STEM fields.
Despite several efforts to revert this scenario, the gender difference in STEM fields has remained the same for decades. This fact points to the inefficiency of previous efforts in addressing this issue
The phenomenon of gender inequality in STEM seems not to relate exclusively on gender inequality. Finland, for example, excels in gender equality, but has one of the highest gender gaps in STEM college degrees.
In this context, the question I want to address is: what can we do to EFFECTIVELY decrease the gender gap in STEM?

What it does

The final project is a simulator that predicts the percentage of Women among graduates in STEM fields based on data on educational policies, economy and politics. 
Users must answer several questions, such as ""what is the employment rate?"" or ""what is the difference in mathematics tests between boys and girls?"" and, at the end, the software will return the expected percentage difference of Woman among STEM graduates. 
The user can also chose a country among a library of 65 countries and, instead of inserting values for the questions, use the values correspondent to the situation of the chosen country in as many questions as the user likes. 
If a country is chosen, the software will also return the increase/decrease of representation of woman in STEM in the user's hypothetical situation compared to the current situation of the country.
In this context, the software could allow governments to test and introduce truly effective measures to decrease the gender gap in STEM fields. Similarly, companies and individuals would also be able to better develop solutions to increase the representation of woman in STEM fields.
Lastly, the results could allow us to create new methods of education specially designed to decrease gender inequality in diverse fields.

How I built it

I used a machine learning algorithm to predict the percentage difference of Women among graduates in STEM fields based on:


Gender difference in science literacy (Programme for International Student Assessment)
Gender difference in intra-individual (relative) science literacy scores (Programme for International Student Assessment)
Gender difference in Self efficacy (Programme for International Student Assessment)
Gender difference in broad interest in science (Programme for International Student Assessment)
Gender difference in enjoyment of science (Programme for International Student Assessment)
Gender difference in mathematics scores (Programme for International Student Assessment)
Gender difference in intra-individual mathematics scores (Programme for International Student Assessment)
Gender difference in reading scores (Programme for International Student Assessment)
Gender difference in intra-individual reading scores (Programme for International Student Assessment)
Global gender gap index (World Economic Forum)
Unemployment rate (trading economics)
Fertility rate (the world bank)
Per capita GPA (CIA)
Government investment in education (United Nations)
Gini index of inequality (CIA)
Number of universities divided by the population (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) and United Nations)
Number of universities among the top 5,000 universities in the world divided by the population (Consejo 
Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) and United Nations)


Challenges I ran into


Leaning machine learning on my own in order to make the project possible
Adjusting the variables so they are in the same order of magnitude to improve the algorithm 
Choosing a good alpha parameter for my cost function to decrease properly
Finding good reliable data for all the countries I wanted to search
Time management 


Accomplishments that I'm proud of


Being able to learn and implement machine learning
Being able to decrease my cost function at each iteration (what shows the machine learning code is working)
Getting results that make sense according to the research projects on gender inequality on STEM I studied
Making something that can have a huge social impact
Finishing the project on time
Connecting with brilliant girls during the hackathon


What I learned

The indices of woman representation in STEM has, in fact, a negative correlation with gender inequality (obtained through the global gender gap index). This result supports the results found in the paper ""The Gender-Equality Paradox in Science,Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education"" (Stoet et. all, 2018), which shows that the countries with the largest gender equality have the largest gender gaps in STEM in secondary and tertiary education. That shows that the causes of the problem may be much more complicated than what we've though and can give an insight into the reason why, despite all efforts towards decreasing gender inequality in STEM, the problem persists. 
A positive correlation was found between woman representation in STEM and indices such as intra-individual reading scores and intra-individual math scores, factors that are usually ignored in solutions trying to minimize gender inequality in STEM.

What's next for WISearch


Introduce more variables (specially related to education)
Introduce more countries
Build a better user interface and a graphic representation of the result
Make the software available for companies and governments to use

women emPOWERed,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/105731-women-empowered,"Inspiration Two computer science and a studio art freshman teamed up at a hackathon. Our task: to create something to light the way for women in STEM. We decided to use this light as the motivation for our app. As you progress through our timeline mapping the history of women who were pioneers in STEM, the light bulb fills up to depict a gradient of light (in the Technica colors, no less).

What it does The app takes the user through a timeline of historical innovations in STEM, all spearheaded by women. It empowers girls to take risks and pursue their own paths to STEM careers.

How we built it We combined our technical and artistic skills using AppLab and Procreate to make the app. We started by sketching out the design for the light bulb, the theme for the program. We then added event listeners using javascript to transition between periods in history and to animate the light bulb.

Challenges we ran into The brainstorming process was definitely a challenge. We struggled to narrow down our ideas to one concrete plan, because we wanted to do so much but only had a brief timespan in which to execute it. This is also our first time at a hackathon, so it was intimidating to get started! Luckily, our team worked well together and we were able to come up with something that felt authentic.

Accomplishments that we're proud of We really like our user interface, and we think that it will appeal to girls everywhere who are interested in STEM.

What we learned We learned how to work together in under 24 hours to create an app! Aside from that, we learned a lot from the events held at Technica, like the Git and machine learning workshops.

What's next for women emPOWERed We hope to develop this into a full time app using Android Studio. Hopefully, it will expand to have more features, like a job inspiration category, which would take a persons interests into account and run an algorithm to predict a STEM-related career that they might enjoy.

MentorMe,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/105771-mentorme,"Inspiration

It's easy to feel discouraged as a female in STEM when you are often surrounded by only men with few females to look up to as role models or mentors. We are all a part of the ACES Honors program at the University of Maryland, College Park and as part of this program we receive the opportunity to be paired with professionals in cybersecurity from various companies and organizations. This mentorship helps us remain interested and receive the support we need to excel in this field. We wanted to create a social media app that could help create this kind of experience for women in STEM.

What it does

The app helps connect professionals in the field to current middle schoolers, high schoolers, and college students looking to pursue a STEM profession. It would recommend mentors to the students based on their interests. There would be a chat feature where students can ask advice from their mentors or have group chats where they talk about their experiences. This would help the girls feel connected and less alone. We wanted to add a feature where there would be a map that mentors could add events to as a way to notify their mentees of STEM events going on. Then, at the events the mentees could check in using the MicroStrategy Usher platform. That could help them find other girls with similar interests as themselves at the event and form networks of support amongst themselves.

How we built it

We built it using Android Studio. We wanted to include MicroStrategy Usher, and Here.com but ran into difficulties integrating them into our project. Using Android Studio we managed to create a login page where users can login and register. 

Challenges we ran into

Issues receiving a license for Usher in order to integrate it with our app. We also ran into trouble with Android Studio due to bugs in the current version of Android Studio. There were also difficulties in getting the map to load properly.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

As a first time hacker I am proud that I managed to start learn a new program and start working with it in a single day. As a team we're proud of our idea, even if we couldn't finish implementing it we hope it will be one day. We're also proud of our ability to come together as a team and create something, despite it not being what we originally set out for.

What we learned

We learned about integrating different SDKs and connecting our app to third-party applications. We learned how to set up a database of users and authentication using firebase on android studio. It was especially helpful that there was a workshop specifically for firebase. We learned how to begin the setup for MicroStrategy Usher and how it works. 

What's next for MentorMe

We would like to continue with this project and make it into a full blown social media network to help connect women in STEM everywhere. We would like to have a fully implemented algorithm for pairing up mentors and mentees. We think this would be a great way to make sure women feel like they're not alone and that they have someone to look up to in their field of interest.

Money Simply,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/105774-money-simply,"Inspiration

We were inspired by the Moneytopia game from saveandinvest.org. The game is outdated, and we wanted to make something that was more accessible and fun for students of our generation. 

What it does

This app provides helpful information about spending plans/budgets, saving for college, and setting smart finance goals. Each section has smart tips, extra resources, and a quiz for users to test their knowledge!

How we built it

We built this using Java in Android Studio. 

Challenges we ran into

We had problems trying to synthesize all of our information and formatting that into the app. Additionally, we ran into some problems with the best way to build our quiz. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of our ability to incorporate everyone's skill sets, and the cleanliness of our design. 

What we learned

Some of us had never used Android Studio before, so we learned how to build an app on that. 

What's next for Money Simply

We hope to have more interactive features and activities to help users be smarter with their financial habits.

InstaCard,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/105777-instacard,"Inspiration

We wanted to help girls to get a sneak peak into basic programming concepts through card (or any visual!) making, which we noticed that a lot of our female friends love.

What it does

InstaCard is a ""programming language"" with a realtime editor that allows users to create an html file through fairly simple syntax and organization. Like a real programming language, it allows both function calling and variable assignment; in fact, its syntax is very similar to Python but is designed for creating HTML visual components. By having this syntax, it allows first time programmers to 'program' a html file while not facing complexity and annoyance in syntax and higher level knowledge in HTML and Javascript. Any change made in the coding area of the real time editor is reflected instantly on the results area on the same window.

How we built it

We first built a realtime HTML editor to test if our idea is manageable within the short amount of time, and then we moved into designing the language and parsing the 'code' into HTML for it to display on the browser instantly. Finally, we worked on displaying documentation for the language so that the users know exactly what can be done here through coding.

Challenges we ran into

We spent a lot of time on the organization of frames and parsing the code, and we were not able to fully implement the functionality to export the file written due to Javascript security issues.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the fact that the code parsing portion and the real time editor work seamlessly with each other.

What we learned

Parsing, Creating a real time editor

What's next for InstaCard

More functions implemented for more flexibility, Expanded documentation, Better UI

'Crunch'ing the Numbers for College Fitness,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/105782-crunch-ing-the-numbers-for-college-fitness,"Inspiration

Personally, fitness is and has been a big part of my life as a played a lot of sports in High School, so I thought why not create a survey that can collect data, that can help those in charge better accommodate our fitness needs. Additionally, my partner is an amazing illustrator and here skills and keen eye would advance the project further into its completion stage. 

What it does

It visually represents a sample of College Students and their fitness routines. Specifically, it represents the relationship between the type of workouts with the time period of workouts and the frequency of these workouts. 

How we built it

We created a simple Google Survey, and shared the link with our college aged friends in order to get quick but reliable data. Then, we exported the individual responses to Microsoft Excel, and processed the data to break it down by time period, frequency, and type of workouts. This data was then graphed, alongside the original data, to create a comprehensive visual representation of the survey outcome. Consequently, we took these graphs to Photoshop to arrange them in a pleasant and simple manner that visually gets the main point across. 

Challenges we ran into

A majority of the challenges came from the conception stage. There were a lot of routes we could head down in addition to our efficient imagination, thinking of ideas that sound amazing, but then realising that we honestly have no way to actually accomplish this. Additionally, the data analysis was a rough road because we aggregated the results incorrectly in the manner that there was no way to compare data sets visually with the current information.  

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the overall effect and considering that I am a first time attendee of a Hackathon, and my partner only has gone once before. Furthermore, we are proud with our ability to collect live data rather then data sets that could have been years old. 

What we learned

We learned how to conduct a research based survey and how to use that information for data comprehension. Additionally, we learned how to use Excel to not only make the graphs but organise and analyse the data faster and more accurately that we could. 

What's next for 'Crunch'ing the Numbers for College Fitness

'Crunch'ing the Numbers for College Fitness next be step to become a web interface that allows client to server interaction, allowing even further exploration of the data. In addition to adding exciting and useful tricks, the future program will allow for the user to compare different data sets in hopes to see different correlations from multiple perspectives, and allow the user to save these graphs for later use.

Positivity Site for Technica 2018

This was our team's first year at Technica. We weren't quite sure what we wanted to create, but we wanted it to be something we could be proud of. Something that was worth dedicating 24 hours to. 

We created PosiTech: a site that allows the user to choose what emotion you're feeling and then gives you feedback, quotes, and affirmations that help the user deal with what they're going through. It was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

From our time here at Technica, we're astounded by the number of things we all learned; from completely learning a new language to finally figuring out git to the interesting computer science stuff that didn't even have to do with our project, we all take pride in what we've been able to accomplish. We were all nervous to attend a hackathon for the first time, but none of us have any regrets. Technica has been an amazing experience and it's been incredible working with such quick, dedicated people. 

And we wouldn't give that up for anything.

Awareable t-shirt: Women in STEM git coding,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/105815-awareable-t-shirt-women-in-stem-git-coding,"Inspiration

We wanted to celebrate women in STEM by publicly sharing their contributions to code repositories. We created awareables, API connected art visualizations on t-shirts, to publicly share this cause for greater social awareness. We thought that elevating women in STEM to rockstar status would garner appropriate respect and interest more people in learning more about or pursuing STEM. We also thought that the sale of the t-shirt as a kit for education would interest more individuals in STEM.

What it does

When a woman contributes to a code repository, awareables updates a live visualization with that contribution. Adafruit.io is used to listen to the GitHub API, and when contributions occur, it connects to an Adafruit FLORA using a Bluefruit module. The Adafruit FLORA updates the neopixels with the visualization to reflect the contributions.

The color indicates the day of the week, and the speed indicates how active GitHub contributions are.

How we built it

Awareables is built using neopixels soldered together, then sewed into a circuit with the Adafruit FLORA. A Bluefruit module provides bluetooth connectivity through a cell phone to reach Adafriut.io, through with the GitHub API data is obtained.

Challenges we ran into

We put the awareable tree together four times. Four times! We ran into shorts and crimps with sewing the circuit, and we wanted to make it a bit sturdier with soldering. We soldered a short strip that worked fine. We soldered the whole thing and shorted it. A friendly hacker explained it would have been easier to have done the soldering from the back of the components, and we should desolder to stop the shorts. So we learned the fine art of desoldering. And then resoldering all of the parts again. And it worked!!!!! Side bonus: we got pretty good at soldering after doing it for hours.

We were not able to successfully get the Bluefruit working. The bluetooth module would appear for connection, then disappear when attempting to connect. We direct-loaded the data to the Adafruit FLORA as a bypass.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

It works! Plus the pretty good soldering piece.

What we learned

A ton more about soldering. Always solder from the back. Say sorry and thank you a little bit less (aka you don't need to apologize for your existence). :)

I.P.A. Chart,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/105901-i-p-a-chart,"Inspiration

As a linguistics minor, I struggled to learn the IPA chart for class when I was first introduced to it. I memorized it for the semester, but it has recently come back into one of my classes and I realized I had to memorize it all over again. It is something I would like to practice, but not necessarily while taking away from other things. Thus, making this learning tool compatible with my Alexa allows me to quiz myself while I'm preparing for the next day or getting ready for bed. I also think my linguistics friends would appreciate the application too. 

What it does

The IPA chart consist of features categorized by the place of the articulation of the tongue and the manner which relates to the air flow. This current proof of concept allows you to ask the IPA chart for particular sounds and then have them play. 

How I built it

I used Alexa's Skill Kit connected with AWS Lambda and AWS S3 to create this application. The expected types of responses was encoded in the Alexa developer console, the logic and responses in the Lambda console, and uploaded the audio files in AWS S3. I watched a ton of tutorials, went through documentation, and put it all together. 

Challenges I ran into

One major challenge was the lack of connection to wifi. Another challenge included the lack of examples in python for Alexa Skills and the a major roadblock with the application working on the simulator versus the actual echo. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I am proud that I finished this application. It is currently 6:14 am and this project will not even likely win any awards because it is such a niche area, but I continued on. I really could have gone home to sleep and enjoyed my bed, but I really wanted to code something to prove to myself of my tenacity and to regain some confidence in this tech world. One of the most difficult parts of being a female in tech is the constantly reinforced imposter syndrome one can get from the environment. I am in the process of trying to expand my skill sets so that one day I can feel like I earned the respect and belong in CS. 

What I learned

I learned how to make an Alexa Skill, what a JSON format looks like, and how to create the equivalent in python. I also read plenty of examples and learned the wide variety of tools that come with creating an Alexa Skill. Lastly, I learned a laugh at my mistakes instead of letting them stress me out. 

What's next for I.P.A. Chart

There is another linguistic chart based on an idea called distinctive features. This chart is even more complicated and harder to remember. I would like to implement that as another intent and also create a quiz mode for both charts. The ideal application would be saying a sound and then having Alexa reply the place and manner. However, there are many variables and issues with this idea such as accents, consistency, etc.

GotBanks?,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/105943-gotbanks,"Inspiration

I currently went to Colombia for my birthday, and we were all so confused how much money to take out for this trip to be successful. So I created a java ""bank account"", to keep track of how much money I'm withdrawing and depositing through the duration of the trip. Yet, no one knew how much it would convert our U.S. dollars into pesos so then I made a trip calculator, to ensure how much U.S. dollars would convert into pesos.

What it does

Account.java
AccountDemo.java
 This is the ""Bank Account"" to keep track of how much money you have from withdrawing and/or depositing.

Traveling.java
This is the receipt of how much pesos your receiving from the cost of you and the other people's plane ticket, the number of nights stayed, and money for expenses. This program will convert the U.S. dollars to colombianos pesos.

Challenges I ran into

Figuring out the right percentages in order to convert the money properly.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

It's always an accomplishment to get for getting it to work properly without any errors in the code.

What's next for GotBanks?

I'm currently working in HTML full time, so it would be cool to convert my current information into placing the calculators into a website.

Technica Hack

Our submission to Technica 2018.

This was a 24hr hackathon where we built a web app called 'Recyclicat' that scans pictures of trash items and helps the user classify them as recyclable or non-recyclable.

Motivation

USA is a world leader in most fields, including waste generation. As one of the most developed countries, it is important that it makes conscious efforts towards reducing the same.

We took a shot at the problem with first educating people about recycling by heloing them easily classify their trash. We also demoed a mock-up of a possibly gamified set-up where where the user is motivated to be more environmentally conscious during their purchases.

Every 12 minutes, someone in the US dies from an overdose on opioids. The misuse of and addiction to opioids (including prescription pain relievers, heroin, and synthetic opioids) is a serious national crisis that affects public health as well as social and economic welfare. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the total ""economic burden"" of prescription opioid misuse in the United States is $78.5 billion a year, including the costs of healthcare, lost productivity, addiction treatment, and criminal justice involvement.

We need a way to keep the public informed of these effects and help encourage them to seek a rehabilitation centre near them.

What it does

Our web app is a data visualization dashboard made through Microstrategy software. We made use of the Usher application and integrated integral and easy-to-digest data visuals to make a more impactful user experience for the public. 

We decided to use a web app to display this information, as most of the public has access to the internet.

Challenges I ran into Nopioids

Time constraint for our machine learning component. 
Trouble importing a dataset that would have been a major part of the machine learning component.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Half of our team are first timers and we all contributed to this project to make it our own. We are grateful to have met one another and create a supportive team.

What I learned

We learned HTML/CSS, Microstrategy software and working on a team!

What's next for

We intend to integrate machine learning to our dataset to give predictive solutioning according to realtime data.

The-Exploit-2,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/105963-the-exploit-2,"Inspiration

Last year we demonstrated how to create a virus and hack a network. This year we wanted to create an Intrusion Detection System to help protect the network.

What it does

We created a program that can read live traffic on a network and tell when a port scan or host scan is taking place. This is often the first step a hacker takes before attacking a network.

How we built it


We hooked up 3 computers so that 2 were on the same network and could talk to eachother. We hooked up the third computer so it couldn't join the network, but could sniff all traffic. We also created a 2 way network tap with 2 one way sniffing ports.
We sent pings, host scans, and port scans between the attacker and target, and sniffed the network traffic with Wireshark and the sniffer computer so we could identify which identify the traffic signature of a host scan and port scan.
We created a program that identifies malicious traffic and clearly displays to the screen when a scan is happening and what type of scan is taking place.


Challenges we ran into


When hooking up the computers we got weird results. With lots of trouble shooting we identified that one of 3 network cables were the incorrect. To solve this we make our own network cables.
We had trouble getting Wireshark to see traffic. We asked for a mentors help and they told us what the problem was and how to solve it.
We had a lot of trouble writing the program. Sometimes syntax errors, other times it was identifying how to write code that could tell the difference between different types of traffic. 
We were also trying to create a network tap where you could see both sides of the network traffic (3 way network tap), but our electrical engineer later learned that the circuit for that was very complex and would have required her to start building it at the beginning of Technica, so she created us a 2 way network tap instead.


Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud that we could create the program and go further to make the program clearly show what what happening on the network.

What we learned


We learned the symptom of using the incorrect/inconsistent wire types on a network.
We learned how to use wireshark, how to analyze data on a network, tell what the data means, and identify strange behavior and scanning signatures.
We learned troubleshooting techniques and honed our programming skills.


What's next for The-Exploit-2

If The-Exploit-2 goes further, it will not only identify different types of network scans, it will identify when malware is running on a network, and perhaps even be able to tell you what type of malware. If we were to also include an IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) that received this information, it could stop the attack and/or scan immediately as it's happening.

Pill Buddy,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/105976-pill-buddy,"Inspiration

We all wanted to do a health-related hack that we could focus on hardware with while still doing some coding. From that we came up will Pill Buddy.

What it does

Pill Buddy is a pill dispenser that will dispense the correct medication at a set time. Pill Buddy is bio-metrically locked so that only the intended recipient of the medicine will take the medication dispensed. The bio-metrics can also be used to keep the box locked for everyone except the doctor and other authorized people. This mechanism is important because it helps get rid of mistakes like mixing up medications and also helps keep more at-risk individuals for drug abuse from taking too much medication and possibly over-dosing.

How we built it

Since we had such time constraints, our dispenser is built from cardboard. We used cardboard for the main body and then used hardware components for the actual working mechanisms. We used an Arduino 101, a micro servo, a fingerprint scanner, and a digital display as our main components.

Challenges we ran into

The main challenge that we ran into was finding the right components to interface with each other. The MLH Hardware Lab had a big mix of components, some of which only work with specific boards. We had to change out our components a lot throughout the day and night.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of being here at Technica and building something. Two of our teammates are new to hackathons since its their first time ever and they just wanted to get in the spirit of it and learn some new stuff. That is exactly what we all did and we couldn't be more proud of that.

What we learned

We learned that you can build things out of very little material and what you can find laying around.

What's next for Pill Buddy

The next step for Pill Buddy is to make a software that works hand-in-hand with the dispensing unit so that the doctors, caregivers, and patients can have their own portals to view their medications on and adjust the dispensing schedule.

Tiny Hack,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/105981-tiny-hack,"Inspiration

As a computer science student, I have many ideas about making programs. However, most of the time, I couldn't find teammates that can help me realize my ideas, so I wanted to make an app that can help students to find teammates. 

What it does

Users can post their ideas in the app. An ""idea"" is consists of Project Name, Project Description, and Number of needed members. These posted ideas are visible for all the users and all the users are able to join this project. Once you join the project, you will be able to see other teammates' email addresses so that you can get together and work on the project! The good idea will never go anymore!

How we built it

We use Android studio to build the app. We also used Google Firebase to store all the information(posted projects, user info, etc). 
This app took us around 20 hours. 

Challenges we ran into

The hardest part of this app is retrieving data from firebase and writing data to firebase since we both never used Firebase in Android App before.
UI design is also pretty hard because we both never do design before, but playing with colors is pretty fun.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We realized our basic concepts in just 20 hours!
Our app has its own icon, pretty design, user-friendly environment.
Team project experience is very important in interviews.
Therefore, this app is very useful for all cs students and has great potential to be the most popular app for all the students!

What we learned

Never give up, even there are many many bugs!

What's next for Tiny Hack

We would like to make another section that displays great apps that are made by teams that are formed in this app.

Since it happens sometimes that many cs students want to make something great but has no idea about what to make, we would like to add a section that can inspire those students. This section might be a discussion board or simply a list of fun ideas that are posted by other users.

We are confident that this will become one of the best apps for cs students ever!

SmartSurfing,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106004-smartsurfing,"Inspiration

Everyone spends a lot of time on the internet, browsing their computers and phones nowadays. It has become mindless, and not surprisingly, a lot of time is wasted mindlessly browsing the internet. You're at school or work, and you're pretty productive. But for some reason you feel like you never get anything you want done when you leave the office. Why?

What it does

Introducing SmartSurfer. It's a lightweight data visualization tool that tracks your time online and gives you statistics on your surfing so you can see how much you are really using various websites, and how much time you are spending on them, whether it is productive( like StackOverflow or emails) or endlessly scrolling through Facebook and Instagram...not so productive. We want to help you get that time back!

How we built it

We built this as a Google Chrome extension using the google Chrome APIs so that we would have access to the users history and current browsing data. We also used python to do predictive modeling on the browsing data, and created a front end web page to show the data. 

Challenges we ran into

Google Chrome extensions are very secure, and all code must run in the browser, something we were not aware of before starting. This made it very difficult to use data visualization libraries, and other JavaScript libraries. We also thought there would be data on time spent on sites, but there wasn't any data on duration using different sites, only timestamps of access. So we had to write our own data collection that monitored how long a user spends on each site. 

One feature we can't put in our pitch in the predictive model. Using naive bayes, we train the user's data to then make a model that, given the time of day, predicts the website you will most likely be using. Unfortunately, getting the python training to work with the js Chrome extension has not been successful yet so all your data is actually just in a numpy array.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

For 3 of our team members, this was their second or first hackathon so we are happy to have a final project to show
All of us had never made a Google Chrome Extension before, and didn't realize that was possible for any regular person to do! It was a great learning experience. We also learned front-end web design skills and UI.

What we learned

That you can make your own chrome extensions with just a little HTML and JavaScript! But also, that Google takes their security very seriously, making it hard to use anything besides vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS. It is also difficult to export that data and host anything on the server side for a chrome extension. Everything must run in the browser, making server-side databases and machine learning difficult!

What's next for SmartSurfing

Features that we planned, but ran out of time for:


Setting goals, and getting our time back! - We want to add a new page where users can look at their browsing data and set goals to reduce time or visits to particular websites


Using machine learning to predict common ""problem times"" for users when productivity is lost, or predict trends for time wasted and used productively in the future. If we tell a user that their browsing habits will lead to them wasting 100+ hours in the next month, that will motivate change!
More advanced and creative data visualization - Rather than just charts, we could have interactive models on the page, and add rewards for meeting reduced time goals, and popup reminders to limit screen time on ""unproductive"" sites.

Dayment,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106010-dayment,"Inspiration

Money management is often tedious and sometimes we slack off on our budget tracking so we lose track of where our money goes. Our team decided to make Dayment to make budget tracking fun and interactive, so that people using our app can make smarter financial decisions. 

What it does

Dayment keeps and categorizes  track of daily expenses,  and asks for user to input budget limit and income. The app converts real time input data into charts, so that it is clear and easy to understand. Keeping on track of the budget for daily streak can unlock badges and the game-like interaction can motivate users to input budget every day.

How we built it

We built the web app with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Maven, and Java. We hosted the web app using AppEngine on Google Cloud Platform. 

Challenges we ran into

We ran into the backend connection challenges as we were originally trying to use Datastore or Google's Sql. However, it would have been too time consuming to set up the Database using the above measures. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the user interface and the user experience that our app provides. The completeness of the app that was accomplished in 24 hours is what we are proud of as well.

What we learned

We learned that hosting database on GCP needs more preparation.

What's next for Dayment

We are planning to compare the user's financial habits to the average American based on their age and gender groups, and make suggestions based on the data. We also plan to connect Dayment to Alexa or Google Home so that the voice interaction provides a new way to interact with financial data.

nextDorm,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106011-nextdorm,"Inspiration

Students living in dorms need to borrow things from each other a lot but don't necessarily know who has what they need or who lives on other floors from them. This tool was designed primarily as a way for a community of college students to share things with one another (make life easier) and get to know the people in their dorms in the process (bring together the student community).

What it does

First, you create an account with your name, email, phone, school name, dorm name, room number, and password. You will then be added to a community of people from your school who live in the same dorm building. You can then access your dorm's page where you can post item requests and respond to other people's item requests (which will also let others see your name, room number, and phone number so you can exchange your stuff).

We also added another page that shows all the names and profiles of everyone in your dorm so you can meet new people living in the same building as you.

How we built it

We built each web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We used python and django to create accounts and for login verification, and we stored and pulled all of our account, profile, and dorm page information from our AWS server.

Challenges we ran into

We had a lot of difficulties figuring out how to use django and bootstrap together. We struggled for a while because every time we added the django framework to a page, our CSS would disappear from the website. We also struggled with creating the AWS database as none of us had experience making/using an AWS database. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud to have integrated the django component into our site for people to create accounts and log in. We are also happy that we managed to create our AWS database and display information from the database on the website and also add things to the database. 

What we learned

This was our first time using django and creating a login page for a website. This was also our first time using an AWS database, so this project introduced us to new tools that will be useful in the future. 

What's next for nextdorm

In the future, we want to have store a list of schools and dorms at each school in the database so that when people start typing in a school and dorm, the site can let you select a valid school and dorm. We would also like to add a community events page and a calendar where people in a dorm can share their nearby events with their new friends.

Home Away from Home,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106019-home-away-from-home,"Inspiration

We had personal experiences with struggling to find lodgings while studying abroad. We thought a tool that would aid students in their search would be beneficial to a lot of people!

What it does

For students looking to study abroad, finding housing accommodations is often one of the hardest parts of planning. Our website consolidates data from a variety of different sources so that you can find information on affordable apartments, university dorms, and homestays all on one website; thus greatly facilitating the planning process.

How we built it

Having no prior experience with web development, we learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We constructed a site using a combination of these. We divided the aspects of the website into functions among the three of us and individually worked on them. We eventually brought the parts together to create a functioning website!

Challenges we ran into

We all have experience in Cyber security. Web development was new for us and we had to learn everything from scratch!

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We took a step into the unknown and learned a lot about a new area of the tech field.

What we learned

EVERYTHING!!!

Help groups and solo travelers to plan their trips.

Inspiration

As college students, we want to explore the world! Several of our team members are currently planning trips with friends, from study abroad in Australia to adventures in Montreal. Planning a successful trip can be complex - that's why we wanted to create an application that would help us organize everything in one place. 

How it Works

After creating an account, add a new trip. Work with your friends in the Itinerary tab to develop a schedule, with suggestions generated from the TripAdvisor API for the best ways to enjoy your time. Use the Finance tab to organize bills and keep track of who paid for what. Keeping track of everyone's expenses will really come in handy when trying to split bills and when paying back friends who covered for you! The Health tab prepares you for any health emergencies in a foreign country. Input any chronic conditions and have them translated and readily available to show locals of the host country in the event of an emergency. Find the emergency contact numbers (ambulance, fire, police) of your host country. Set up emergency contacts to be called in case of emergency.

Causality Analytics for Smart Manufacturing,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106028-causality-analytics-for-smart-manufacturing,"Introduction

With the popularity of Supervisory Information System (SIS), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, we can easily obtain abundant sensor data in manufacturing. 

We could save manufacturing maintenance costs and prevent further damages if we can analyze the possible anomaly casualties among the IoT sensor data.

This project applies different data science approaches on anomaly detection/prediction and causality analysis. 

How we built it

We created the project in Jupyter Notebooks using Google Colaboratory, a cloud-based platform where the entire team can work on the project in real-time. By leveraging the ability of Python’s VAR libraries, we implemented the statistical method of Granger Causality to aid the prediction and detection of anomalies within the data.

Challenges we ran into

Indexing the time and date for the required syntax of the Python VAR library was one of the largest challenges encountered in this project. 

The .CSV file that held our real-world dataset was actually delimited by semicolons (;), not commas (,) as expected. Thus, for a while, we received a number of errors when running our code. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

The collaboration of our all-female team was incredible! Our team members had never met nor worked together before. Our greatest accomplishments have been identifying with the purpose of Granger Causal analysis and incorporating it towards an interoperable program with boundless applications.

What we learned

Statistical analysis with programming libraries and data visualizations can relay pertinent information for innovating and preventing system failure across industries.

What's next for Causality Analytics for Smart Manufacturing

Applying this knowledge to save the world! 

Whether in manufacturing, critical mission systems, healthcare, and more, predicting anomalies in data helps anticipate and identify issues before they happen. This work has the ability to not only optimize resources by 
identifying disparities in the needs and operations of systems, but especially in the case of healthcare, has the potential to save lives by identifying anomalies under time-sensitive conditions.

You Can STEM,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106038-you-can-stem,"Inspiration

As women in STEM, some of us from different academic and professional backgrounds, we are really passionate about encouraging others to join STEM fields. We aren't developers, we aren't computer scientists, but we work in tech - we love the work we do and want to send the message we wish we'd gotten when we were younger - anyone with the interest and passion belongs in tech as exactly who they are.

What it does

You Can STEM is a platform that encourages girls to explore STEM applications in their areas of interest. We really wanted to build a platform where girls can see themselves in STEM, through discovering their own interests, seeing girls their age doing cool stuff, learning about what's happening in STEM, and also by seeing women who are really at the top of their fields. There are tools to find passion projects to learn about STEM, to connect with mentors, and to support parents and educators in helping their girls identify and pursue fulfilling career paths. We designed it for mobile, but it also works on desktop.

How we built it

We are a group of human-computer interaction masters students, so we went all in on our user research process - or as ""all in"" as you can get at a hackathon! We completed five 20-minute interviews with women who are either in or have a window into the world of STEM.  We also wrote up a survey to understand experiences of people in STEM and sent it out to our graduate program and Technica Slack channels and did some background research online. Then, we analyzed our user research for high level themes and quotes and followed the Google Ventures Design Sprint methodology to come up with our final design.

The key aspects to the GV Design Sprint methodology are map, sketch, design, prototype, and test. Typically, this happens over the course of a week with one day focusing on each of those aspects. We did a 'quick and dirty' version of an already abbreviated design process, which led us to the prototype we're presenting to you today.

Challenges we ran into

The time limit was certainly the biggest challenge! We would have loved to spend more time polishing our prototype or even pushing ourselves to try to code - we are designers, not developers, so we definitely were out of our comfort zone in zipping through this prototype. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We pushed ourselves as designers and chose to focus on user research. The methodology we focus on in school is called Contextual Inquiry, which is a lengthy, in-depth process. Taking on this challenge of designing with an abbreviated version of an abbreviated process was a stretch for us, but we're really happy with how it came out and how much we learned. As a group and as individuals, we got some great insight into how we can move even more smoothly next time.

We are so excited about how many incredible people we connected with during our research project and the enthusiasm we felt from the Technica community. We wrote up a survey and sent it out to the Technica Slack channel and within two hours we had more responses than we imagined! Everyone we met at the hackathon was willing to share their experiences with us, and we're proud of the way we captured that energy and used it to build this platform. Our team is also proud of building a platform that we would have loved to use ourselves - messaging and encouragement are so important for anyone making big career choices, and we hope You Can STEM is a meaningful way to do that for brilliant, passionate girls around the world!

What we learned

We learned about Design Sprint methodology and got some serious experience with guerrilla user research. We also learned a lot about communicating while tired...very tired...

What's next for You Can STEM

Next, we'd like to build out You Can STEM a little bit more - polish up our images, add some body copy - and get it in front of some real teenage girls to see what they think. We'd also like to do some usability testing and iteration and see what we end up with!

GlobeLight,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106039-globelight,"GlobeLight

project for Technica2018

It’s hard to know whats going on around the world. Usually, we’re so focused on what’s going on around -us- that everything else gets drowned out. 

This was the idea that inspired GlobeLight. I believe that this map will unify people and give life to the places we can't physically see. GlobeLight is a map that shows real time data of geological events that are happening around the world. It will project things like earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes--with this map, we will be able to know what's going on around the world. 

My end goal for this project is to make a functional art piece

I want to create a map of the world and cover it in LEDs that will change color depending on the events that are occurring. 
I believe my projects current state is a small step in that direction. 

GlobeLight is a small web application that integrated google maps and real time geojson data from USGS (united stated geological service) to show the same information.

Currently shows

techtheway,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106044-techtheway,"While thinking about how we wanted to execute our ideas, we had to think about what will appeal to the audience, what will make them want to keep reading and most importantly, what will we do inspire them. Having little to no experience with programming, we wanted to make sure that whatever we do code turned out to be as inspiring and fun to read as possible. After having a thorough discussion and brainstorming ideas, we decided to approach our project in two different ways. 
To start off, we coded a website using Komodo Edit and Git Hub and chose HTML as our programming language. We coded ""Tech Over the World"" by using the basic HTML knowledge we had. The idea behind our project was to inspire women all around the world to learn more about careers in the STEM Field and hopefully pursue them. Today, only 25% of women work in the STEM field. As women, we think it is crucial for more of us to explore careers paths outside the ""norm."" We strongly believe that women need to understand that they are so much more than cooks and secretaries and housewives; women are strong individuals with a determination and passion like no one else. We really wanted to emphasize that with what we made. The second way we approached this project was with WIX.com. We wanted to make our website to appear the way it would when we finished coding it. 
As for the future of this project, we plan on making an app that incorporates all aspects of the website and adds some new features. In the app, we plan on having a chat box that lets women all around the world discuss their thoughts and ideas about Technology and other aspects of the STEM field. We hope to have volunteer mentors that will provide those in need with assistance. We will have postings about upcoming hackathons and tech events around the world by incorporating the geolocation tool. We hope that ""Tech Over the World"" empowers women everywhere to consider and follow a STEM career path in the future.

Journey42,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106045-journey42,"About

We are Journey42 (journey for two): a website that matches you with a person who also want to travel to your dream city. 
Browse through a list of locations you want to go for the next vacation, add them to your list, and match with somebody with the same destination. Chat with them, become friends, and go on a journey together! 

The Motivation

Traveling is a enriching experience. We recognize that there are people who want to travel around the world but don't want to travel alone. So we wanted to help those people and connect them through this website.

Next Steps

We will implement machine learning and AI to automate the process and output a list of recommended users with similar geographical interests instead of having to search up a specific location. 
Additionally, we will implement time as well, where people can specify the time frame they're free, and it would make the matching more fit. 
Security is also a big aspect to consider. In the future, we will require people who sign up to verify personal information by providing phone number, a real photo, and a form of ID.

PreSafe,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106046-presafe,"Inspiration

Recently, one of us had a violent threat at their school - a suspected school shooter. This close to home experience shone light on how real the issue of gun violence in American schools is; this is a fear that teens across the nation face everyday. The approach to student safety and shooting prevention/preparation is in need of a dire change.  

What it does

PreSafe aims to prevent shootings before they ever begin - students can report suspicious activity or threatening behaviors they encounter both in the real world and online, students can upload photos of said suspicious behavior and name the perpetrator so dangerous situations can be avoided. 
As well as this, PreSafe provides students with preparation and resources in the event of shooting. PreSafe stores maps of each floor of your school - allowing a student to find the room or exit they are closest to. LockDown drill protocols/procedures are also included to avoid confusion and avoid potentially life threatening mistakes.

How we built it

After struggling with react native and linux for a while and downloading every software known to man, we tried something slightly more feasible. Someone suggested that we use ionic because it was ""more user friendly"" but then we attended the app development workshop and decided to use Xcode with Swift instead. We used Python flask to connect the motor to the app.

Challenges we ran into

We wanted to include a hardware aspect that would alert students of the threat silently, to avoid further chaos. We tried to create an LED Alarm that would blink on command using a Dragon board with a restful python API to connect it to the app. This was unsuccessful despite our six hours of traffic back and forth from the hardware table. After a lot of difficulty with the Dragon board we  then tried to use an Arduino device with Python and it worked, the LED did not work as well as we wanted it to, so we changed it to a little motor that raises a cautionary flag when called.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our final product is cohesive, fairly aesthetically pleasing with a simple logo and app icon. As well as this, having begun with an HTML website and only beginning this final app idea at midnight - we did not expect to have come this far. 

What we learned

The basics of making an app:
How to use XCode, coding in Swift, 
We also learnt the basics of hardware and API
We also learnt python flask
And most importantly this taught us how to actually start a project and get the framework up and functioning, prior to this none of us knew how to actually make and start a project.

What's next for PreSafe

If we had more time we would expand to hardware, specific user logins and a text alert system.

FEMpower,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106061-fempower,"Inspiration

We extremely inspired when we came to Technica and saw over 800 girls and women coding, a lot of whom were in high school and middle school. We wanted to create a web application that would pool together resources and statistics for them as well as raise awareness about women in tech. 

What it does

It displays different aspects of the current women in the technical field as well as opportunities for young women to find their path in the STEM field and go forth to make a change through internships available through Indeed. 

How we built it

We used atom to edit CSS, HTML and JavaScript code. We used python and flask as the back end. For the statistics tab, we embedded micro strategy data visualisation. We also used a form to record the survey answers of users and then provided them with their best fit. Used data from Indeed.com to display internships in real time for women in STEM undergrad in college.

Challenges we ran into

We struggled with integrating front and back end and learning to build a web application. We also struggled with incorporating the microstrategy platform.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Embedding micro strategy, Our first time doing web development and half the team had never been to a hackathon before.

What we learned

How to integrate APIs, how do develop web application, how to integrate front end and back end

What's next for FEMpower

We home to actually register the domain and plan on working further, adding more features, basically create an all in one site for women in technology.

Technica2018,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106062-technica2018,"Our game is a life scheduling simulator that we created with the goal of helping players get a handle on the importance of managing their time and money. The player is supposed to try to maximize the amount of good their character can do in the world while also making money and taking care of their personal happiness.
The main game mechanic is the monthly scheduler, where players can decide how many days they want to spend on certain activities. These activities either increase of decrease the player's money, happiness, or ""social good"" scores, which track the three main ideals of the game.
After deciding what to do with their time every month, players are presented with a series of random event choices that can also effect their three scores. These event simulate the unpredictable occurrences that happen in real life in order to show the importance of budgeting money and time for such events.
We had a great time making this game during Technica2018, and hope you'll have fun playing our demo!

TrueColors,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106066-truecolors,"Inspiration

As a deutan, I find myself dealing with ignorance around the topic daily, and it's prohibited me from pursuing careers that I'm passionate about. We created TrueColors to spread awareness of deuteranopia as a new perspective instead of a limiting factor for careers, so that our society can begin altering integral parts of jobs to not be color based, and therefore discriminative against deutans, who make up 8.5% of our population. 

What it does

TrueColors simulates deutan vision in real time, using Google Cardboard goggles for a more immersive experience. 

How we built it

We built this by coding a C# script to access live camera view, and then applying a deuteranopia shader on top of the camera. We then made the program VR accessible and put it in binocular rendering to be compatible with our Cardboard goggles. 

Challenges we ran into

We had trouble putting all three colorblind shaders on one app (protanopia, tritanopia, deuteranopia), so we had to limit the app to be exclusively for deutans, which is the most popular type of colorblindness. We also had some trouble with the WiFi, which made downloading the necessary SDKs and Vuforia license keys difficult.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we could figure out how to code in Unity with virtually no experience! It was a fun and challenging learning process, and the end result was gratifying. We expect to create more VR/AR programs in the future.

What we learned

We learned how to debug an Android phone, and we learned the ins and outs of Unity. One of us learned what it's like to see with deuteranopia, which was a great opportunity to spread empathy on this subject. Coding in AR was a learning curve for both of us, but through perseverance and determination, we were able to succeed in our project.

What's next for TrueColors

In the future, we hope to include protanopia and tritanopia in an iOS app with a clean, user-friendly interface, with faster image rendering and less magnified binocular rendering.

Paint Your Dreams,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106067-paint-your-dreams,"Inspiration

We were inspired from another app, one that allows the user to log the amount of water they've been drinking that day. As a result of the amount of water they drink, they will be able to watch a plant grow. We wanted to try our hand at developing a mobile application that uses positive reinforcement to do something similar.

What it does

It allows the user to submit any personal goals they have accomplished and see colors on another screen change as they progress.

How we built it

We wanted to create an iOS app, so we began by using XCode. However, neither of us knew Swift beforehand, so we built the logic using Javascript. Afterwords, mentors then helped us translate Javascript into Swift and, through various obstacles, we finished our app.

Challenges we ran into

As neither of us knew Swift beforehand, we had a lot of trouble completing this app. The language was difficult to adjust to and XCode was hard to adjust to. Thus, we had a lot of troubles regarding this app, most of which we received helps from mentors in order to accomplish. For example, we originally wanted this application to show shapes that progressively gained sides instead of differing colors, but we found that creating shapes in swift was especially difficult. As a result, we changed the display from shapes to what it currently is now: changing colors.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We finished this app in time!

What we learned

We learned Swift!

What's next for Painting Your Dreams

Even though our original plan was to make it so that this app was more aesthetic, due to obstacles presented by trying to adjust to Swift, this goal was not fully accomplished. In the future, we want to try to make the app both prettier and more functional for the user. We would also like it if we could implement the original idea and have shapes that change in our main screen. Furthermore it would be ideal if we could animate this and optimize for other iOS platforms.

Health Matters,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106068-health-matters,"Inspiration

What inspired us to build this project was the amount of diagnosis that occurs every day because symptoms are only considered from the perspective of one doctor and not a multitude whose differing opinions could actually lead to a correct diagnosis. Keeping this in mind, we created Health Matters, a self-diagnosing aid, to take in your symptoms and data points such as age and gender and give you an accurate portrayal of what a person at said age and of said gender should look out for. We hope that with this project we are able to bridge the gap between the patient and his or her accurate diagnosis and lead to better preventative medicine.

What it does

Our web app allows users to obtain personalized recommendations about clinical preventative measures tailored to his/her age, sex, and/or pregnancy status.

How we built it

We utilized the healthfinder.gov API and integrated outside datasets for machine learning analysis and visualization. To present these findings, we built a website using HTML/CSS. We modeled our project after GitHub repository called Healthcare AI.

Challenges we ran into

We ran into multiple challenges halfway through our project such as finding a decent API which matched all our requirements and was still available for use. We also had trouble connecting the back end of our project to the front end of the project because none of us were well versed with javascript or CGI which put our project on hold for a few hours while we figured out what to do. We also ran into merge conflicts on git because of which we had to stop and evaluate whose requests should be accepted or denied where.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we have a fully functional website that conveys all our information and that we able to successfully apply machine learning and data visualization to two major datasets. We are also extremely proud of the fact that a user can get information on demand about what he or she needs to look out for at that stage in their life.

What we learned

How to use JavaScript, APIs, and how to actually implement machine learning in python

What's next for Health Matters

Next steps involve an implementation of a database for providing care and pharmacies related to the personalized results and more characterizations of preventative diseases. We also hope to do a similar analysis for multiple diseases in the future.

Two Cents,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106076-two-cents,"Inspiration

I have POTS, (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) and I am also a really dumb college student who forgets basic self care aka staying hydrated. For patients with POTS and other illnesses such as sickle cell, it is very important for them to not only stay hydrated but to NEVER get to the point where they are even slightly dehydrated. We created a wearable device that yells at the user (reminds them by sending them alerts through a phone app) to take care of themselves BEFORE there is a need for more severe intervention. 

What it does

This device reads resistance across skin, which is related to water content in the blood. Of course it is not a definite indication; however, it is correlated, which is why a great portion of our project was focused on user feedback and calibration.  The most important aspect is the reliance on user feedback and that is how we hope to differentiate our device from other wearable devices. 

How I built it

Two cents literally. We built the ""impedance""(we initially intended on having an AC current) measurement device by simply putting two resistors in series. One, a 2.2 MO resistor, and the other-- you! The person's measurements were taken by applying two make-shift electrodes, that where actually just two cents, to the wrist. The data was read and processed through Arduino and then fed to a UI that went through a bunch of symptoms for each measurement and subsequently associates the severity of the symptoms to the measurement. The UI will ultimately be calibrated to the user and will predict a percentage for the chance of the user experiencing certain symptoms based on previous user input. Since the measurements will be taken continuously for an extended period of time, ideally the program will be able to predict the symptoms before they occur in the patient. 

Challenges I ran into

I didn't have electrodes! Then I found some cents. Ok sorry, its not funny anymore. Anyways, we started out with the intention of building an android app and ran into some trouble with downloading and installing so for time sake we decided to make a web-site instead (at about 5 this morning). Additionally, I never used html or java before so it was quite an experience learning 5 hours before the hack was over and get user feedback.

One of the biggest challenged was getting the data from Arduino to be read live by our program. We ended up making a text file that was continuously updated and read by our program. That required getting processing to write text to a txt file. We figured it out at 3 am. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We asked for a lot of help. I know that does not sound like an accomplishment but we could not be proud of what we did if it was not for all the help we received from mentors and peers. So yes, I would say our biggest accomplishment was realizing other people know much more than we do. I am also really proud of our working sensor :)

What I learned

So much... Arduino, javascript, the art of improvisation and how much we can get done if we don't sleep! (jk)

What's next for Two Cents

We hope to improve the user interface and perfect the hardware design so it can eventually be a comfortable  wearable device that prevents symptom flare ups.

Make Your Own Bingo,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106078-make-your-own-bingo,"Inspiration

I came up with my own words that I wanted to put on a bingo card. Whenever I want to solve a problem I always think about coding my own solution first!

What it does

You enter any words that you want on your Bingo card. Click the create board button and the program makes the card for you. You can click on any cell on the Bingo board and it will mark it off as checked. You can click the create board button again to reset your card. The program automatically randomizes the order of words entered so there is a unique board every time!

How I built it

To build this program I started with HTML. I build the skeleton of the web application first, then I coded the javascript behind the HTML skeleton to make it work.

Challenges I ran into

The biggest challenge was making sure the board cells were square no matter what was entered into them. When you play Bingo, you want a square board. But if you enter a long value for one square the formatting gets messed up and your Bingo card won't line up anymore. To fix this I had to learn something new. I used div elements over top of each cell to make sure they kept their shape. I had never worked with div before, so this was a learning experience.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I am really proud that I got my program to do what I wanted it to in general. At the beginning I knew this would be a big program for me to complete. I am proud I completed it! I am also proud I was able to make the table be square no matter what was entered

What I learned

I learned a lot about HTML. I haven't used it in a few years, and it was really nice to refresh my skills with it.

What's next for Make Your Own Bingo

I want to make the program look more visually appealing. Right now it does its job and it looks bland. I want to spice it up, add some pizzaz.

Destroying the Patriarchy!,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106083-destroying-the-patriarchy,"Inspiration

Our inspiration for this project was the challenge presented by JPMorgan. We felt immediately drawn to this challenge because we ourselves love computer science and want to inspire others to join the field as well. As most women know, there are many stigmas around the sciences being considered ""nerdy"" subjects, leading to less 25% of women in STEM jobs. We wanted to present a virtual world where you can literally shatter these stigmas yourself.

What it does

In our game, you are taken to a futuristic world with exciting music playing with many objects that have descriptions on them. The goal of the game is to destroy all the objects, each of which represents an injustice or a misconception women face every day.

How we built it

We built it mainly using the game development environment Unity with C Sharp scripts to supplement that code and create animations and transformations. We created all of our music using Garageband and some characters in the game were developed in Blender.

Challenges we ran into

The main challenge was just using the program Unity, seeing as only one of our group members had prior experience developing in it. We are all CSA students, but we don't really have much experience in Hackathons or languages other than Java. However, after many youtube videos and online tutorials, we were able to create a game we are all really proud of.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are really proud of how we learned how to use Unity as a group and how we were able to make an awesome game that we hope will inspire others to shatter unfair stigmas or double standards in their own lives.

What we learned

We learned so much, as mentioned before, about Unity and how C sharp files can create transformations to game objects. We also were able to talk to some great mentors and get some really great advice as to how to make our passions into a career in the future.

What's next for Destroying the Patriarchy!

We initially wanted to close the game out with the player closing a door labeled ""Close the Wage Gap"" to have a more conclusive and cohesive ending to the game, however because of time constraints, we were not able to add that aspect in. I know we will all keep playing with Unity in the future, so maybe one day we'll create a Destroying the Patriarchy! 2.0 .

Crime Cookie,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106085-crime-cookie,"Inspiration

With violence an ever present threat in our area and our education exposing us to a wide range of cybersecurity risks, we were inspired to create a platform that empowers our community to safely report incidences that often times go unreported, and to guide them to the proper channels to positively impact our community though civic involvement and support. 

What it does

Crime Cookie is a witness crime reporting platform. We created this website to pull together the different local and national reporting, tip, and help services to try to solve the reasons these problems go unreported and uninterrupted, making our community and our online presence that much safer. By giving the proper authorities more information about the crimes that have occurred and enlightening them of ongoing situations, Crime Cookie could make a significant impact on the speed and accuracy of investigations.

Impact

The overall impact is to increase social involvement and community safety. Additionally, cybercrime has become pervasive as our dependence on technology grows. Both businesses and individual users are impacted by the threat and risk of cyber attacks and crime everyday. Yet, a great deal of these attacks, successful or not, go unreported. 

How we built it

Crime Cookie was written in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery. The user interface design was developed in Sketch.

Challenges we ran into

This project overall requires a lot of time and we were not able to incorporate all of the fully-functioning features that we wanted within 24-hours. We initially wanted to develop a mobile application for Android; however, due to unavoidable constraints, we made the decision to change the platform to a desktop website.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of having developed a website that approaches a relevant problem in our community. We also learned a lot about working as a multidisciplinary team and were able to complete a significant portion of the project in under 24 hours. 

What we learned

During our time at Technica, we learned how to use HERE.com's mapping API, register a domain name on Domain.com, use a third-party vendor to facilitate account creation and login, and develop a static mockup in Sketch.

What's next for Crime Cookie

We are excited about future possibilities for Crime Cooke. We are interested in developing additional functionality and expanding the reporting categories. We also want to release a mobile app version and implement interactive games geared towards educationing users about services in their community.

Find Restaurant,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106086-find-restaurant,"Inspiration

At this hackathon, people come from all over the country to bond over our uniting factor: girls in tech. The bonds formed at Technica are irreplaceable - the joy elicited from developing a creative idea, the night-long collaboration and reaching ""ah-ha"" moments - they last a lifetime. When these friends want to have a reunion, they often will want to meet at a place close to halfway between the two. That's why we created Find Restaurant: to find a nice restaurant around the midpoint of two friends.

What it does

""Find Restaurant"" finds the closest restaurant to the address you enter in.

How we built it

Using the Google Home Actions developer, we created this ""Action"" to interact with the user via Google Assistant, providing a hands-free interaction with the computer.

Challenges we ran into

Our unfamiliarity with the developer interface and lack of proficiency in Javascript provided complex challenges, however we quickly adapted to the new environment to produce the Action.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud that we were able to integrate the Yelp API with the Google Home Developer Console. We're also proud that we were able to grasp the Developer interface and new programming language within 24 hours.

What we learned

We learned how to make our first Google Home Action, which can be accessed via Google Assistant on an Android device in addition to the Google Home AI. We also learned Javascript within the course of the hackathon.

What's next for Find Restaurant

Next, Find Restaurant would determine the location around which to find a restaurant halfway between you and a friend. It would also integrate not only restaurants, but also entertainment venues, sightseeing attractions, and other common meetup activities.

Fundz for Funz,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106087-fundz-for-funz,"Inspiration

According to multiple studies, Millennials (the generation born between 1980 and 2000) are the only ones in recent history who are financially worse off than the previous generations. Yet, according to the data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey, Millennials outspend other generations on eating out and consuming alcoholic beverages. We believe this is due to many reasons, especially the rise of ""Food Porn"" culture on Instagram. To help Millennials make more fiscally sound decisions. we developed Fundz for Funz, which makes budgeting more fun.

What it does

FundzforFunz creates a ""fun budget"" for the user by collecting information on their monthly income and expenses. The cupcake represents the budget. Every time a user ""digs in"" to the budget, the cupcake gets ""eaten"" which represents their budget depleting. When the user has completely run out of funds for their budget, the cupcake is fully eaten and the user receives a warning message to cut back on their spending.

How we built it

We built the server using python and the flask framework. The data is being stored on dynamodb and managed with dynamodb ORM for python. Finally, the server is being hosted on amazon EC2 servers. For the front-end graphics, we used Vectr and Canva.

Challenges we ran into

Two thirds of our team members are first time hackers, while the remaining member has never developed an Android app. This was our first time collaborating on a project together since we are also from different schools. We all pushed ourselves by using technologies that were completely new to us. Additionally, we ran into issues with connecting to the internet in the beginning which affected our progress initially as we were unable to watch important tutorials on using Android Studio that we needed due to our lack of experience.
Connecting to EC2 was also an extremely hard challenge. We launched it multiple times and everything became very confusing for hours since we did not have prior experience with denamodb and EC2. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to build a functioning prototype at Technica! 

What we learned

We learned the importance of communication in team projects, as we initially struggled with finding a good platform to communicate with. Ultimately, we ended up creating our own Slack channel in the Technica workspace to collaborate.

What's next for FundzforFunz

In the future, we will be creating a widget on the homescreen that shows the user how much of their budget is still remaining. Additionally, we would like to create a button on the widget that allows them to easily state that they depleted their budget. We will also send out reminders every Monday if the user has not spent any of the money in their Fun Budget to ensure they haven't forgotten to enter it in. This app can be developed further as in it can provide the user with different tips and short paragraphs to help them manage other financially related matters. It can serve as tip of the day or different articles that the user can refer to whenever they have time. Another implementation would be asking if the user has long term saving goals. With inquiries about debts and plans for taking out potential loans, it can guide the user to know if it is practical to manage paying them off on a longer term.

MoneySaver,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106090-moneysaver,"Inspiration

Creating an interactive platform to help people learn about the cost of saving and expense, and hopefully help people save money for their goal.

What it does

A modified version of the monopoly game that allow user to make a choice of what item they want to spend they money on. Each item has its cost and description that help user makes a wiser decision.

How we built

We use open source framework and designed it with Java, Shell and Perl. 

Challenges we ran into

Navigating around the framework. Review java jframe and swing libraries. Sleep deprived.  Working with the limited java graphics class, which build the majority of the framework, to build an interactive experience.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to finish our project on time. It works!!!

What we learned

The pro and cons of using framework. Depending on the framework and, it may help boots up the time to finish the project. The coder can focus more on the functionality of the framework rather than the layout designing part. However, if the framework is difficult to use and navigate then it can also slow down the project 

What's next for MoneySaver

Make it prettier. Redesign the layout. Embed it to a website and sync it to mobile device. Document the whole process in GitHub

What it does

Using a simply weighted Python-3 code, it assigns weights to several different career choices depending on your answer choices.

How I built it

Using Python-3 software and a lot of googling.

Challenges I ran into

I had a lot of trouble with tabbing and spacing - Python is really finicky!

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We're really proud of the end results system - it was quite a challenge!

What I learned

We learned more about Python's interface.

I am learning Chinese and I told my roommate to send me a playlist of songs in Chinese and I ended up really liking one of them so I really want to learn the lyrics in pinyin! The song is called bān mǎ.

What it does

You enter text into the text box (lyrics) and place in the '8' character for splicing. As you press space bar each piece would appear on screen.

How I built it

I used HTML, CSS and Javascript.. and some jQuery

Challenges I ran into

I never really learned java or jQuery, I was without wifi for sometime, and I needed to get acclimated to a new dev environment! 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

It does what I need it to do to learn Chinese!!! I got the on press listener to work and the text splices correctly!!

What I learned

I learned that jQuery is pretty easy to use if you set it up right and I learned how weird HTML buttons can be.

What's next for bān mǎ

A WAY BETTER UI that slides from either left to right or from up to down depending on what the user specifies. Hopefully a timing method of splicing will be an option for those who want to use it.

theSeatingChart,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106098-theseatingchart,"Inspiration

We arrived at Technica yesterday confused with the current seating situation, as well as the organization of the hackathon as a whole. Finding seating in the venue was difficult because there were no assigned seats, and we could not find 4 seats together. There was even a point where we were asked to move after we had been working for about 6 hours. This was inconvenient and effected our work on our project. In addition, the process of forming teams was tedious. Some people even attended the conference without knowing who would be on their team. 

What it does

theSeatingChart is a webpage that displays a map of the current Technica venue. With this map, a participant can conveniently hover over a table and see the names of all of the people at that table. It is a pre-assigned seating chart that will allow for a decrease in disorganization and confusion. We hope we can update the program so that people can choose their own group, and so that people can view if there is less than four members, and request to connect with the team members. This webpage can be integrated in the current and future Technica Apps and Websites. 

How we built it

The reading of hackers, classifying them into groups and assigning them to tables, and then exporting this information for use in the website was done using Java in Eclipse. We found Java to be the easiest language to implement the logic with as it is an object-oriented programming language. We had four classes: Person (the hacker information), Table (table information), a Team class (Includes tables and person objects), all put together with our Driver class. The logic simply took in a text file with information separated by commas, read each line in to get Hacker information, added each Hacker into a team of 4, added the team to the next free table, and then wrote the Team information to a new text file. Currently, all variables are set to Technica specific details (Team Size = 4) which can be easily adapted to adhere to other conferences.

For the front-end of the program, we had to use a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The HTML code was used as a webpage to display the interactive image-map. We had to map out the coordinates of the certain areas we wanted to highlight (i.e. the tables) so that we can assign team members to those highlighted areas. We then used CSS in order to design the basics of coloring, text, etc. JavaScript was used to connect our Java backend program to the HTML front-end

Challenges we ran into

Choosing an idea that wasn't already implemented.  This was our third idea and we started it after 7 hours of working on 2 other projects that ended up already being products.

Another challenge we ran into was getting the exact coordinates of the areas we wanted to highlight on the png file. Since it was our first time trying to make an interactive image-map, we had to look up how to do it. There were various conflicting answers to our problem, and so it took a while to write up the code that we actually needed. 

The last main challenge we came across was trying to extract the data that we had in a text file to display in a certain area of the image-map. We didn't really have experience with JavaScript and GitHub so it took a while to be able to use those tools. 

Connecting the Back-end to the front-end also took some time. We had to get help from mentors and learn how to integrate Java and HTML together. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We learned how to utilize GitHub, which is a very valuable tool. We also learned how to make an interactive image-map. How to style text in HTML and JavaScript. 

We're also submitting a working product in our first Hackathon. This is a very big accomplishment because we did not know what we were walking into when we came here. 

What we learned

We learned JavaScript, GitHub products planning, HTML, Java, and how to work with people outside of our majors and skill sets. 

We also learned that even though we are in college, we can still ask for help from our mentors and peers. We collaborated with mentors in our project. 

What's next for theSeatingChart

To make update so that people can choose their own groups. We also hope that we can make it so that a group who has less than the given max of members can search for other attendees to join their group. This could be made by making members take some type of mini-survey about their interest and skills they have. This will then put people who are not already in a group together so that they can work on a project together. We can use machine learning to best implement this idea.

"Emma, the STEM SuperHerO",https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106101-emma-the-stem-superhero,"To inspire

Women still hold less than 25% of STEM jobs. As middle schoolers, we created this project to interest women in STEM with a small game and short story.

What it does

This is a short story about how a supergirl, Emma, came to save the world by using her STEM power. She eventually became the town's number one emergency help and has to save the world.

How we built it

We created a domain, STEMSuperHERo.com, from domain.com using MLH coupon code. Then created a virtual machine in Google Cloud using the free $100 credit from Technica. Used Google Cloud DNS API to transfer STEMSuperHERo.com purchased from domain.com to Google Cloud. Used Google Click to Deploy to set up WordPress VM.
We also used WordPress to create the webpage section.

Challenges we ran into

It was challenging to find the right hosting service to create our game and website. Luckily Technica, MLH, domain.com, and Google Cloud provided a good combination for the powerful hosting service.  

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the fact that we were able to draw the character on Scratch and create our own website.

What we learned

We learned that in order to create a website on the Google Cloud Platform, we needed to use the Click To Build Wordpress. We also learned about new website building tools such as Domain.com, and a website builder. 

What's next for Emma, the STEM SuperHerO

Emma the STEM SuperHERo is going to rescue more people. While doing this, she will encourage young women to employ in a STEM-related job. In every story, Emma will use one of her degrees to both rescue the world and encourage more young women to be interested in STEM.

A teammate came up with the idea for this app during her own experience with dialectical behavioral therapy. She was diagnosed with biploar disorder and the therapy helped her regain control of her symptoms. 

What it does

Provides a daily diary card for user to track skills learned and used, provides a game platform for users to learn new skills, gives user realtime analytics of historically tracked data, encourages users along the way to continue improving their mental health to reach the goal of a fulfilled life. We approached the project with a human centered design lens and wanted to build something that was easy to understand, beautiful, and rewarding so people want to use it.

How we built it

We found our team through Slack posts prior to the event among general interest in building a mental health app. One teammate sketched a few wireframes before arriving and once we got together and met in person, we all started working on our separate pieces. One member built the backend using AWS, two members worked on the front end through Android Design Studio. Our fourth member built assets and supported design decisions while developing prototypes in Adobe XD.

Challenges we ran into

Setting up AWS as the secure backend. No wifi. Seamlessly merging project files without the use of wifi. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our layouts. Human centered approach.  Creating a product that can help people in need. Launcher screens. Learning a ton. Making new friends. Completing a product. Teamwork, an awesome team!

What we learned

Set up the backend first. Sit near the network switch. Collaborate more beforehand. XML. Android Design Studio interface. Skills in project management. Teamwork. Get a mattress first.

What's next for Wise Mind

We want to implement mood, anxiety, energy, sleep and custom symptom trackers. Provide support for finding a therapist. Be HIPAA compliant. Build out more of a web presence. Medication notifications.

What it does

A trivia question regarding STEM is displayed onto the serial monitor with four multiple choice options- a, b, c, and d. When one player thinks that he/she has the correct answer, they can hit their button. The first person to hit the button can then type the letter that corresponds to their answer choice into the keyboard and then hit 'Enter'. If the answer is correct then the green LED light will light up and the buzzer will sound twice; otherwise, if the answer is incorrect then the red LED light will light up and the buzzer will make one long buzz noise. 

How we built it

Our team utilized a combination of hardware configuration and the Arduino IDE to create a functional game. First we set up the Dragonboard 410c by connecting it to our keyboard, monitor, and our input and output devices using jumper cables. We then tested out ideas on Tinkercad.com which allowed us to test Arduino C, wiring, and code virtually online, and we settled with an educational trivia game idea. With the help of the knowledge gained from multiple hardware workshops and the Arduino C language reference guide, we were able to reach our final product.

Challenges we ran into

The most prominent problem that we ran into was that none of us had experience using Qualcomm hardware or coding using Arduino IDE. Our team had to do a lot of troubleshooting in order to work out the many syntax errors that we had. Time was of course an issue; additionally, our team has problems with wifi connectivity and with our hardware programs crashing. Despite all of this, we tried our hardest to work efficiently and reach our goal: creating a trivia game that teaches users about STEM.

Accomplishments that we are most proud of...

Being able to effectively use and the connect the Dragonboard 410c to our code.

What we learned

It was our first time using Arduino C, which meant that we had a lot of errors (especially syntax errors); but it also meant that we were able to learn about the documentation of Arduino IDE from fixing our own mistakes. Additionally, we gained experience with using different input and output devices and how to program them with the Dragonboard 410c.

What’s next for STEM Trivia

In the future, our team hopes to incorporate an easy to use graphical user interface. We feel that this addition will make our game more visually appealing and it could potentially make the game easier to play.

Sleep Extension,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106118-sleep-extension,"As high school students it is difficult to maintain a healthy sleep schedule. We created this extension hoping that it will help others go to bed at a healthy time and sleep better each night, so they can have greater productivity.

This extension tracks the bedtimes of user daily and displays this data back to them to help motivate them. We also asked users for their friends to keep them accountable in maintaining their bedtimes.

We used javascript, html, css and chrome api's to create the extension.

Combining javascript and html was difficult. In addition using the chrome api to create our domain also proved arduous.

Making a functional website that effectively tracks data for users. In addition, making the website user-friendly was good.

We learned how to create a actual extension with a domain name and chrome apis. We also learned how to combine html and javascript.

We want to make sleep extension incorporate alarms and notifications to better motivate users by alerting them.

Common Cents,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106129-common-cents,"Many Americans lack financial literacy or financial management skills. In our own experience, this is due to a non-existent or subpar education on the subject. Not only do our current systems fail to instill beneficial financial values in students from an early age, but provide only a few opportunities for adults, especially those in lower socioeconomic classes, to learn how to create an effective budget or to utilize a budget that will facilitate their path to solvency. As a result, we created Common ¢ents, an application that guides users’ financial habits through budget suggestions that are flexible and dynamic, based on the costs of living and financial data from the user’s location.

Common Cents takes in data and builds a budget plan based on the customer's current balance and personal preferences/priorities. It displays the information in the app by utilizing Microstrategy Data Visualization.  Our app circumvents the common weaknesses of budgets, including unnecessary rigidity, lack of specificity, and disregard of details pertaining to not only the user, but the conditions around them.

We used java to build the foundation of our calculation and combined xml, java, and android development kits to create the interface of the app, in addition to utilizing microstrategy’s data analysis and visualization

We didn't quite know how to build an app or use xml. As a group coming together for the first time at Technica, we experienced problems using GitHub and combining our versions of the app. Moreover, creating the graphic user interface was a challenge as none of us had used applications germane to this goal before.

We are proud that we learned how to connect linking activities with button on xml. We were able to put together a project somewhat comprehensible, despite working together for the first time. Finally, we are proud that we learned how to accept input from an android app.

We learned how to use xml to import fonts and integrate languages to create a GUI, as well as how to use GitHub as a way to bring together code. 
Common Cents is planning on integrating the Google Maps API to use location information to compare prices in the area that fit within the budget. Depending on where the user lives and their mode of transportation, the location data will enhance the capabilities of our project by enabling us to create a more personalized data plan that takes into account variables in addition to the users’ data. Thus, our project will become more holistic and appealing to users, who will not be able to access the the comprehensive cost analysis data that Common cents incorporates into its algorithm. Furthermore, we plan on tracking the user’s expenses to create an algorithm that will adjust the budget accordingly, and on creating multiple visual graphs for the user to easily interpret their budget. We will use MicroStrategy to create the graphs.

Educating Women in STEM,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106133-educating-women-in-stem,"Inspiration

We were inspired by the lack of representation of women in the STEM and we wanted to collect information that could be easily shared so that people could be adequately educated about what they could do.

What it does

It is a collection of information about the representation of women in STEM, encouraging women to pursue careers in STEM, no matter what age. We included activities that are easy to complete within a few minutes so that people visiting the site can get a taste of the things that STEM has to offer. We also included statistics that are easy to visually understand and inform the user of the underrepresentation of women in STEM.

How we built it

We created a website using HTML and CSS, integrating MicroStrategy graphs and trying to integrate an interactive Java applet. We were able to generate the MicroStrategy graphs using data that we researched online.

Challenges we ran into

We were not able to integrate our Java applet because of depreciated libraries and the lack of usable WiFi, especially when getting set up. We also tried to host files on Amazon Web Services and utilize Java Web Start to deploy our Java applet. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of creating a finished product that we can feature on our organization's website, JMU Women In Technology. We are also proud of how much we learned in creating a Java applet and interactive data using MicroStrategy. 

What we learned

*The most productive time is early in the morning when everyone else is asleep. 
*How to use Run-Time objects to receive text from the console to simulate running Java code in our applet. 
*How to work together as a team to create a finished product in a limited amount of time.

Mythonancial,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106138-mythonancial,"Inspiration

As college students, we see the mystery of the real world creeping over the horizon, and with it intimidating concepts like credit scores and trading. We sought to create a fun and engaging web app to help educate our peers, while enjoying our time. In addition, we wanted to emphasize that anyone, regardless of gender, can learn and improve in the world of money.

The Story

According to Greek mythology, maidens would be annually sacrificed to the terrifying Minotaur residing in the Labyrinth. The tale goes that Theseus slayed the Minotaur and was the hero of his story, but here one of the maidens fought back. You play as Pecunia, one of those maidens left to her fate in the maze, but she can beat the odds! By educating yourself on finances, you will best the Moneytaur and escape the Labuyrinth stronger than before.

How we built it

We used mainly JavaScript, and Phaser.js to help develop the overworld maze. Then, the individual challenges are completed fully using JQuery and CSS, to keep the player invested in their experience. To enhance the questions inside of each puzzle, we incorporated MicroStrategies Embedded Analytics. By making complicated data clear, learning becomes even more intuitive. 

Challenges we ran into

We found some issues learning game development strategies within Phaser.js, specifically in creating the maze. However, we were able to learn a lot about world building and understanding game theory. Now we understand and appreciate game designers even more than before!

Accomplishments that we're proud of

The concept has the possibility to reach so many people, and draw a new crowd to the exciting world of financial literacy. So much more in life makes sense after understanding financials, so we want to improve other women and student's lives.

tour-ward,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106141-tour-ward,"Inspiration

Traveling to a new country can be daunting because of cultural differences, language barriers and currency confusions. These things can ruin the travel experience. 

What it does

Our app helps connect travelers to locals in the areas they are traveling to. These people have been vetted and can ensure an interesting and authentic experience. 

The app allows a user to search by location and receive a list of attractions from the TripAdvisor API. They can then see which locals are available in the area to show her around. She can read their reviews, interests and message them to schedule a meeting. 

The app also uses dialogue-flow to provide accessibility to visually impaired customers. The app also tries to connect travelers with volunteer opportunities in the area. 

How we built it

This is a web app built using Node.JS and Javascript for the backend. We got the latitude and longitude from the Mapquest API and used these coordinates to receive the information from the TripAdvisor API. The frontend was built using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and Handlebars.JS. For a database of users, we used mongoDB. We used Github for collaboration and Heroku for deployment.

The dialogue-flow was built using Google Assistant.

Challenges we ran into

It was difficult working with the TripAdvisor API at first. We needed to access two different APIs so it was difficult to coordinate the data in the right way. However, with the help of a mentor, we were able to get it to work. We also had to think about how to make sure our users were safe when using the app. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud that we learned to use a new API and created a cool idea that we believe can help travelers. 

What we learned

We learned how to work with different APIs. How to use git commands to make teamwork efficient. How to integrate two APIs and work with Javascript promises. We also learned how to power through on two hours of sleep! 

What's next for tour-ward

The opportunities for this app are endless. We really want to implement the security features like user authentication and background search. We also want to add functionality to other features, such as sort by type of attraction -- like restaurants, museums, parks, etc. We also want to implement an airBNB style payment method.

What it does

This chat bot was programmed as an question and answer machine. So far, we have curated certain questions such as ""Where can I find mental illness aid?"" This question will trigger a response we created telling the user to go to the parents tab.

How we built it

We downloaded node and then created a new bot kit in the command prompt. Then, once the bot kit was online, we went onto cisco webex teams platform and customized the chat bot to fit the topic of our website.

Challenges we ran into

Initially, we wanted to implement this chat bot into our website and have it on a new tab however, getting the json file to cooperate with HTML was very difficult. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're happy that we at least got to customize the chat bot a little bit so that when we eventually implement the chat bot onto our website, we have some custom questions.

What we learned

We learned about node, and we learned more about navigating around the command prompt.

What's next for i am me chat bot

Next, we want to add another tab to our website and add this chat bot onto it. When we do this, we will also incorporate more question/ answer features. Lastly, we will try to link certain tabs in our website in the answer so that the user can redirect him/herself onto the page they are looking for.

GoAid,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106149-goaid,"What is GoAid?

The future of mobile apps is increasingly community-based, where everyone is linked through a common interest, need, or want. And though there are many social media apps that use maps or the user’s location, GoAid specifically targets people in your community who need help. Like Snapchat’s Bitmoji map, GoAid displays requests from people in your area who could use your help. This function could be implemented into any social media app, such as Instagram or Facebook, so all questions and needs would be shown in a map, separate from status updates and pictures. These could range from a neighbor asking for help weeding, or a parent having technical issues with their iPad. Users will be able to earn points and badges that count towards actual money and sponsored giveaways, as well as service hours for high school students. By making help more accessible to others, it allows for homes and communities to grow and be more inclusive.

#talkpay,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106151-talkpay,"Inspiration

We are inspired by the #talkpay movement, which promotes equal salary wages through bringing attention to the increasing wage gap. With this in mind, we encourage transparent conversations regarding salary and advocate for equal pay regardless of gender, ethnicity, affiliations (ie. religion) and/or background. 

What it does

Our application is built with the hopes of providing our users with insights on salary for companies of their choice. The user is able to (1) browse and filter their content to gather insights, as well as (2) share their demographic information and salary. To ensure that all submissions are valid, we have configured AWS Cognito for users to register and verify their email. 

Dataset collected through Facebook group-- Hackathon Hackers: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gmTNiNqv5pGco-uNK7ghjwP6pa3LYpK1fr_QK-R9Pko/edit?fbclid=IwAR2WnH1UNbxMwtGJ7WXx7lIBghO0YEzgQtYGjvJ4K6tyz1XyUFhnJQTGYA8#gid=621480135

How I built it

We utilized the Angular framework and Ionic to make our application cross-platform. We also used NodeJS and Amazon Web Services DynamoDB for our database. In addition to this, we used Amazon Web Services Cognito to manage our user authentication, while also ensuring that all submissions are truly anonymous. Our data visualizations are generated by chart.js & Angular2 Charts.

Challenges I ran into

Cleaning up the dataset available to us.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We built an end to end app and we made it to the end!

What I learned

We learned how NodeJS works, AWS DynamoDB and Cognito in Javascript (instead of Java), Angular, and Ionic3 to make things cross platform!

What's next for #talkpay

There's lots more to be built out! We've only been able to capture the proof of concept, but we hope to capture and give more in depth analysis of the information we have. We should also be validating this to see how this app can best serve our target users in situations like salary negotiations etc. On a technical aspect, during registration, we would like to add another verification to ensure that the user's email is a valid company's email.

Travel Quiz,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106155-travel-quiz,"Inspiration

I wanted a more accurate quiz that could tell you the best place for you to travel to based on your personal preferences and personality.

What it does

The Machine Learning algorithm uses your quiz results in data numeric form to calculate where you should travel based on a database of previous quizzes and the places those people actually wanted to go to.  There are 26 options for places to travel to that will be recommended.

How I built it

I used an SVM to calculate a result based on where people said they'd like to go to when they filled out the quiz similarly.

Challenges I ran into

It was difficult transferring my data from a Google Sheet to an array that could be inputed into the system.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Building an algorithm that could output semi-accurate predictions for an opinion based question.

LightHER,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106160-lighther,"Inspiration

As minorities and women of color in the tech industry, we were inspired by the idea of bringing like-minded individuals together through a single platform. Our idea stemmed from personal experiences, from once being mentees, to now being mentors to other young women in technology. 

What it does

LightHER is dedicated to matching women with mentees and mentors in STEM. Our team of developers' goal is to build a community through an interactive interface that will allow mentees and mentors to filter matches based on interests, location, age, and goals.

How I built it

Challenges I ran into

I am not too well versed with using Git and the command line and struggled to understand the commands at first, until finally growing comfortable with it enough to be able to utilize it with the rest of my team. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

While the website is not 100% complete, I'm incredibly proud of the message behind it and what we are trying to share with women in tech who may not have the confidence to get out there to meet with other industry professionals who are just like them. This website is to let women know that they are not alone! 

What I learned

I was able to get a better understanding of utilizing Git and the command line as well as got a little more experience using Bootstrap, which I typically don't use when building websites as I prefer starting from scratch. 

What's next for LightHER

LightHER is a project that I want to keep working on after Technica ends. Uniting women in technology is a long term goal of mine and is a very personal one, especially because of the fact that I am on the e-board of an on-campus organization in New York dedicated to doing this everyday.

Chro·map·tic,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106162-chro-map-tic,"Chro·map·tic

Chromaptic is a visualization of the color schemes that best represent cities in the United States. The program parses photos from different cities posted to Unsplash into the Clarifai API, to return the dominant color of the photos, which are then visualized on a map. Users are then able to hover their mouse over the map markers to get the name of the city, the color palette, and preview one of the photos that was used to determine that city's color.

The motivation behind this hack was to determine if there exists a color that best represents a geographical location. Where are the real amber waves of grain/purple mountain majesties? Is Los Angeles more blue? Is Phoenix more orange? How does color scheme potentially affect mood, and is it able to predict trends across geographical regions?

First, we utilized the Unsplash API to search for photos by keywords to get the photos tagged with each city. Then, those photos were run through the Clarifai API, that offers image and video recognition as a service, to get predictions of the dominant colors in the images. These colors were then used to create a gradient bubble whose size is proportional to the city's population, that marks the city on the US map. We utilized cities.json, which provided data on the top 1000 cities in the US, to create the map and its elements.

ClubHub,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106164-clubhub,"Inspiration

As freshman at University of Maryland, we were excited to look at all the clubs and organizations our new school had to offer. While the First Look Fair was a nice taste, there were only so many clubs we could see and talk to at a time. After that, we decided to do our own searches using OrgSync, the ""go-to"" site to see all of UMD's clubs. But when we looked on there, the site seemed cluttered, out-dated, and abandoned by most organizations. Long story short, it wasn't much help. So, we decided to create a new way for students at UMD to see the most up-to-date events and posts from our university's hundreds of clubs, all in one place! ClubHub is a website (and soon mobile app) that will help Terps find and communicate with clubs. 

What it does

ClubHub is simple and easy to use for students and club organizers. On the home page, there are two options: find a club or register a club. For students, they would select ""find a club"" to search all of the university's clubs and organizations. The clubs are separated by various categories (academic, athletic, service, etc), and Terps can select all the areas that they are interested in for a more customized approach. For club leaders, they can choose to register their club and create an account with ClubHub by providing a club name, description, contact, upcoming meeting(s)/event(s) (in order to get the app constantly up-to-date for students) and typical meeting location.

How we built it

We created both a website and an app prototype for iPhones. The website was created using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. For the app design and demo, we used proto.io. 

Challenges we ran into

Since we are both beginner hackers, it was a real challenge getting started and learning how to actually create things from scratch. The front-end took up most of our time because a lot of trial and error was needed to see how different displays looked. Probably one of our biggest challenges was trying to use python framework (like Flask or Django) for our website. Unfortunately, we didn't manage to include that in our finished product, but we definitely will in the future. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are so proud that we were able to make our first, functioning website and design. There were definitely times when we felt like giving up, but we managed to push through and created something that we are both proud to show others. 

What we learned

This was both of our first real hackathon experiences and we have learned so much from this experience. We 

What's next for ClubHub

Since we weren't able to use a python framework within our project, that is what we will try to do next. We will specifically try to use Flask for back end data and storing club and account information. In addition, like we have already discussed, we will try to make ClubHub mobile using Swift and Xcode and eventually bringing it to Android devices as well using Android-Studio.

Kidvest,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106165-kidvest,"Inspiration

Our team wanted to create a hack for social good. As believers in the power of education, we developed a game with a goal to better educate middle schoolers about money management. 

What it does

Kidvest is a web-based RPG that teaches the user about the basics of investing through analogies to the adventure’s quest. 

How we built it

Built using JavaScript and HTML

Challenges we ran into

We found it challenging to come up with the idea of our hack and to explain fundamental financial terminology and concepts that middle school students could comprehend and enjoy.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Collaborating with each other to decide our hack
Researching a topic outside of our comfort zone
Creating and developing an interactive story that incorporates key financial concepts

What we learned

We learned that teamwork makes the dream work! And communication is key.

What's next for Kidvest

We hope to expand on this concept by covering other money management topics and increasing our target audience (high schoolers). Our vision is to equip students with fundamental financial management skills through our fun platform Kidvest.

Paws and Found,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106170-paws-and-found,"Inspiration

According to the American Humane Association around 10 million dogs and cats are lost and stolen each year. Only around 22 percent of these dogs, who are found and taken to the shelter, are reunited with their families while only 2 percent of cats are. 

When you have lost your pet it can feel hopeless and navigating the many places to report them can be overwhelming. The idea behind this project was to create a one stop way to report a lost or found pet that would search local areas and post to social media and other sites for you. 

What it does

At the moment it allows users to access our webpage to report a lost or found pet at the following location: http://www.squeakcode.com/pawsandfound/. Depending on their selection, they are directed to the next page (lost pet page or found pet page) where they can fill out a form and submit their information. 

How we built it

We used HTML, CSS, and bootstrap to design the webpage. To host the webpage, we used AWS. Additionally, we used Google Cloud database to store the information provided by the users.

Challenges we ran into

We originally wanted this to be an App, but due to the internet not working, we were not able to download the required Android packages and resources. Additionally, we had had not worked with with Google Cloud so, we spent some time learning how to use Google Cloud services.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we were able to create something after all the technical initial issues that we faced. 

What we learned

Some of the members learned how to create a database, while others explored the various tools of webpage development. And while the project did not become an app, we explored Android Studio, which can be used in the future.

What's next for Paws and Found

For our project to be fully functional, we need to complete the following tasks:
-Take user input and store it in the Google Cloud database.
-Allow users to upload photos and store them in the database.
-Use Cloud Vision API to compare newly uploaded images to those stored in the database.
-Create a gallery page that allow the users to view pictures of all the pictures stored in the database.
-If a match is found in the database, generate a message to contact the person who posted the picture. 
-Once the pet has found and claimed by the rightful owner, remove the picture from the database and remove the post.

CommunityCarpool,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106171-communitycarpool,"Inspiration

After experiences in the ride-sharing market that were impersonal and sometimes felt unsafe, we felt that our idea of ridesharing with neighbors was a great and safe alternative for people of all ages to get where they need to go while also bonding with members of their community in a unique way!

What it does

CommunityCarpool allows users to select their community within the app and then pairs neighbors who are offering rides and requesting rides to the same place in order to make sure all members feel safe and connected to their community.

How we built it

We started out brainstorming ideas for multiple hacks and sketching them on paper. Once we decided which challenge interested us the most, we laid out the design for all of the content for each screen of CommunityCarpool. After this, we used HTML to encode the UI for our webpages. Then we used jQuery and wrote Javascript code to add functionality and make the website interactive with the user. We also incorporated the Google Maps API so that users of CommunityCarpool can select locations that they are going to or need transportation to.

Challenges we ran into

Our first challenge was really just coming to a consensus on a hack we all wanted to work on that we could get reasonably done within the time constraints of the hackathon. In addition, we had to learn new things as we went along, utilizing the strengths of different team members. We also didn't have any prior experience with jQuery or APIs in general. So, we ran into issues that we didn't know how to approach at first, but with guidance from Google and the mentors we were able to implement our new knowledge in this hack!

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the fact that we stepped out of our comfort zones to create something we never have before. Also, for two of our three members, it was our first hackathon, so we were proud to have been able to work in a collaborative environment with so many female peers!

What we learned

We learned how to code as a team and work collaboratively under pressure! It was awesome to be so committed to an idea that we had the experience of working non-stop the whole night to finish. We also learned so much about jQuery and APIs that we're excited to share with other students back at our schools.

What's next for CommunityCarpool

We hope to learn how to code in AndroidStudio in order to turn CommunityCarpool into a mobile app. In addition, we would like to devote more time to the UI to make our application more user-friendly.

ECO_LIT,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106174-eco_lit,"Inspiration

I am currently a rising-senior majoring in Biology with an Ecology concentration and minoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am always looking for new ways to combine my interests in programming and promoting environmental sustainability. 
I wanted to create something fun and educative that people of all ages could use and what better way than to develop a game. 

What it does

ECO_LIT is a game that promotes recycling of plastic. 

How to play:
Players move a recycling bin left and right using the keyboard arrow keys and collect as many plastic bottles as they can. If 3 bottles reach the bottom of screen without being recycled, its GAME OVER! A message displays the player's score and a fact about plastic consumption. Players can choose to play again to beat their score or quit.

How I built it

I developed the program using python programming language and importing features from pygame and tkinter modules. The pygame was used to implement main animations and display, while tkinter was used to generate pop-up messageboxes. 

Challenges I ran into

Some challenges I ran into was learning how to use tkinter and to install pygame successfully. Thankfully, I found some helpful posts on stackoverflow.com and Google.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

This is my first hackathon! I am really proud that I was able to challenge myself to learn two new modules and develop a game in two days! 

What I learned

In terms of programming skills, I learned how to import and implement two modules. I also learned the basics game design and development. However, I also learned that I can accomplish anything I put my mind too and that I should never doubt my capabilities.

What's next for ECO_LIT

I hope to develop more levels for ECO_LIT of increasing difficulty such as faster falling speed of bottles and creating obstacles in the game. I also hope to develop an alternate version of the game that deals with collecting food and paper into compost bins. This will expose players to another sustainable practice and give them two versions of the game to play.

Pack-It List,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106178-pack-it-list,"We were inspired by our own experience of coming to our first hackathon to create the framework for this product: Pack-It List. None of us were incredibly sure what items we should bring, if we brought too much, or if we forgot an essential. We thought to ourselves: if we are having a hard time packing for an overnight stay, what must it be like for someone who has never traveled to pack for their first time to a new state, or a new country? Packing lists online are often conflicting or inaccurate. We wanted to create one place, one database, where someone could type in their destination and receive one easy, accurate packing list. 
Our expertise lies in branding, designing, and creating a cohesive concept. We played to our strengths and created a concept, wire frame, and logo for our website. One of the topics that we learned about in one of the Technica workshops was Machine Learning or Deep Learning. We determined that this could be incredibly useful with our concept and with further research we would want to integrate such an algorithm.

Digital Therapist,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106193-digital-therapist,"Motive

We both attend a high school with the highest suicidal rate in the county. We decided to make a learning, growing, robotic therapist to help people who are struggling like students at our school. 

What does it do?

It has a get help and give help section. The get help section is meant for clients. The clients will be able to talk to the digital therapist while it replys back to them. The give help is password protected. It is meant to be used only by professional volunteers as they are the ones who can analyze how the clients respond to the digital therapist and edit the response if needed in order to improve the program. 

How we built it

We used java. In our program we customized our own therapist tree node and made various of ArrayList to organize the text. We also used GUI. 

Probems we encountered

It broke randomly and seemed to be obsessed with catching or throw all tiny baby IOExceptions. We also pulled an all-nighter (#hardcore).

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we stayed motivated to complete our program (#sleep is for the weak). We are also only a two people group but felt like we made a lot of progress. 

What we learned

We haven’t done a GUI for awhile, so of course, we had to relearn it. We also learned that at 6 am, caffeine doesn’t work anymore.

What’s next for Digital Therapist?

It will go online as a website anyone can access and will continue to grow as professionals will improve it.

How I built it

Using HTML, CSS. Was Planning to include PHP and JavaScript but I was finding out of time to get it all functional.

Challenges I ran into

I had trouble trying to figure out APIs for the map feature, but I'm hoping to tackle that task soon. For now, a static image will take it's place and a list will appear of the locations instead.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Finding a problem and learning how to solve it - Hackathons should be easy to find for everyone no matter who they are.

What I learned

I learned that nothing is made over night and if I want this to be made a reality, I would need help from others and take my time to perfect the page.

Neuron,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106216-neuron,"Inspiration

Most people who struggle with a mental illness have - at one time or another - been blamed for their condition. They can feel avoided, isolated, and ostracized during some of their toughest times. While mental illness reaches far and wide, affecting 1 in every 5 adults in the United States alone, the negative stigma surrounding it causes people to feel ashamed of something that is out of their control (NAMI). Ultimately, stigma prevents people from seeking the help they need. 

Many experts believe that this stigma arises from the disconnect and miscommunication between neurotypical and atypical people. The term “neurotypical” describes people without a mental illness while “atypical” describes people diagnosed with a mental illness. According to Unite for Sight, “people with mental illnesses are less likely to finish high school, enter college, or start a career. They also show an increase risk at poverty.” Family members and caregivers experience chronic stress and heavy financial costs. Overall, the disconnect shows a divide and weakened community of neurotypicals and atypicals.

Now the question being raised is: “What are people doing to help?” Currently, there are a couple of mobile applications that aim to help people with mental illnesses by tracking mood, supporting a journaling system, and allowing users to chat with professionals. While these applications have unique features, there is no current mobile application that targets both neurotypical and atypical people.

What it does

Our solution is a new mobile application, Neuron, that will provide users the ability to connect with others, gain valuable insight, and share personal, mental health relatel. We believe that the best way to end the harsh stigma surrounding mental illness is by diminishing the disconnect between neurotypical and atypical people alike. Educating everyone, not just those diagnosed, ensures that everyone understands each other and allowing atypical and neurotypical people to begin taking steps towards recovery together. The mobile application Neuron was designed specifically for this purpose. Just like its name, Neuron strives to connect the two groups through dialogue and communication. In turn, this will diminish the ambiguity encompassing mental illness, ultimately diminishing the stigma that surrounds it. 

With much thought we concluded that the most effective process to connect both atypical and neurotypical people is through a mobile application platform. This allows the user to have easy access to the platform whenever necessary, be it on the bus, waiting in line or just before bed. Furthermore, a mobile application is a very simplified and clear-cut tool. As mentioned above, mental illness is both complex and puzzling, having a clear and simple tool to learn about the topic allows users to be one step closer to making mental illnesses understandable. 

Neuron is an application platform that allows users easily and effortlessly share their personal stories about mental illness with others on the app. Therapist Lois Hartman noted during an interview that “journaling is a great technique for dealing with mental illnesses or overwhelming emotions”. People can comment and message other users with direct questions or kind, uplifting comments - all with the purpose of bridging the disconnect and creating a safe space to converse. 

This application will ultimately foster a community of understanding between neurotypicals and atypicals. Millions of people in the United States have a diagnosable mental illness, and even millions more have a close friend or loved one with a mental illness whom they actively support (NAMI). While mental illness is a broad and sensitive topic to tackle, we believe that Neuron is the first step in the right direction to initiate diminishing the stigma surrounding mental health. 

How we built it

To build the app we used ionic framework in visual studio. The app was broken down into various classes (pages), and each page had a corresponding CSS, HTML, and TS file. Furthermore, to create dynamic features like a scrolling bar or a linked button, we created objects for those.

Challenges we ran into

We ran into many challenges. Our first challenge was downloading node.js properly. One of our team members couldn't type in any commands with npm because she installed it twice, and didn't delete the old files. Another challenge was creating our chat page - the SCSS code wasn't recognized and created an unknown bug that we couldn't diagnose. Lastly, creating the backend was the most difficult challenge we experienced. We did not know where to start, since we've never stored data before. Ultimately, one of our team members tried to work on the backend and it did not end up working - however, with all these challenges, we learned so much!

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are so proud of creating this app - which attempts to bring awareness to mental health, especially on a college campus. Even if we don't win, we are so excited about the impact that this app can make in today's world.

What we learned

We learned about node.js, ionic framework, Android Studio, HTML5, TypeScript files, and how to work in a team!

What's next for Neuron

We will finish developing the app to ensure it reaches its full potential. All the functionalities and specs we would have loved to finish before this submission will be done for sure!

Who Runs the World?,https://technica2018.devpost.com/submissions/106219-who-runs-the-world,"Inspiration

We thought about enamored us as children: dress-up, decorating rooms, and other games. We then decided to combine those aspects to create a game that not only appeals to young girls but also teaches them the code behind the game. We wanted to introduce coding to girls in a welcoming environment where their curiosity can flourish. 

What it does

It allows girls to design their own world while also learning the code behind it. Users input values (inserting an object of their choice: person, place, background, etc.), see the code behind the object based on their input values, run the code, and also see the final output immediately. This provides immediate feedback and the girls can see how powerful their code is. Through this, they ""run"" their own world and make it their own. 

How we built it

We used Visual Studio's Windows Form in Visual C#. The graphics were made in Medibang Paint Pro and Pixaki with an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. The backgrounds were open sourced. 

Challenges we ran into

The most prominent is making the images' backgrounds transparent in the game and make them able to overlap each other. We also faced difficulties in finding out how to place images based on the user's position of their click. The hardest part of the project was making up the idea and the logistics of it afterwards. Combining customizing the world  whilst teaching java was a difficult balance to maintain because the game could easily just be another ""make your own home"" game or be a Java textbook. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Being able to create a complete, working program in a short amount of time with a team is what we are proud of. 

What we learned

We learned how to work as a team and negotiate to pursue a common goal. We also learned about object-oriented programming through Visual Studios Windows Form. We also learned that even though one of us did not know how to code, there were still many roles that they could play. 

What's next for Who Runs the World?

We could add more assets and expand to more languages. We can also increase the difficulty for older audiences who already have some background in programming. This can be done by starting them off by filling in blanks of an actual script to code their own properties and eventually creating their own programs. Additionally, more graphics can be made to ""pretty up"" the game, such as custom buttons, a loading screen, and other refining features of a game to appeal to girls further.
